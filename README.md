## üöÄ Overview

Poetry Syntax Highlight is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to provide rich syntax highlighting and improved readability for Poetry project configuration files (`pyproject.toml`). This extension enhances your development experience by making Poetry configurations more visually appealing and easier to navigate.

Poetry is the modern dependency management and packaging tool for Python projects, and this extension ensures that your `pyproject.toml` files are properly highlighted with accurate syntax coloring, making it easier to work with complex Poetry configurations.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üé® Enhanced Syntax Highlighting**: Rich color coding for Poetry-specific TOML sections and syntax elements
- **üìù Poetry-Aware Language Support**: Custom language definition (`poetry-toml`) with intelligent recognition of Poetry configuration blocks
- **üîç Improved Readability**: Better visual distinction between different configuration sections with specialized highlighting
- **‚ö° Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with any `pyproject.toml` file - automatic file association
- **üéØ Focused on Poetry**: Optimized specifically for Poetry project structures and conventions
- **üöÄ Performance Optimized**: Efficiently handles large `pyproject.toml` files with hundreds of dependencies

### Comprehensive Syntax Highlighting

#### **Poetry Sections**

- **Project Metadata**: `[tool.poetry]` with highlighting for name, version, description, authors, etc.
- **Dependencies**: `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` with special highlighting for Python and package dependencies
- **Dependency Groups**: `[tool.poetry.group.<name>.dependencies]` for dev, test, docs, and custom groups
- **Scripts**: `[tool.poetry.scripts]` with command highlighting
- **Extras**: `[tool.poetry.extras]` for optional dependency groups
- **URLs**: `[tool.poetry.urls]` for project links and references

#### **Version Constraints & Dependency Formats**

- **Caret Constraints**: `^2.28.0` - Compatible version updates
- **Tilde Constraints**: `~1.21.0` - Patch-level updates
- **Range Constraints**: `>=1.10.0,<2.0.0` - Version ranges
- **Exact Versions**: `"1.2.3"` - Pinned versions
- **Complex Dependencies**: Support for extras, git, path, and URL dependencies
- **Conditional Dependencies**: Platform and Python version specific dependencies

#### **Advanced Dependency Types**

- **Git Dependencies**: `{git = "https://github.com/user/repo.git", rev = "main"}`
- **Path Dependencies**: `{path = "../local-package", develop = true}`
- **URL Dependencies**: `{url = "https://example.com/package.whl"}`
- **Dependencies with Extras**: `{extras = ["all"], version = "^0.104.0"}`
- **Conditional Dependencies**: `{version = "^1.0.0", markers = "sys_platform == 'win32'"}`

#### **Build System Support**

- **Build System**: `[build-system]` section highlighting
- **Requirements**: Poetry-core, setuptools, and other build backends
- **Backend Configuration**: Proper highlighting for build-backend specifications

#### **Tool Configuration**

- **Poetry Tools**: Enhanced highlighting for Poetry-specific tool configurations
- **Third-party Tools**: Support for `[tool.black]`, `[tool.isort]`, `[tool.mypy]`, etc.
- **Nested Configurations**: Proper handling of complex nested tool settings

### Language Features

- **File Association**: Automatic recognition of `pyproject.toml` files
- **Custom Language ID**: `poetry-toml` for enhanced tooling integration
- **Comment Support**: Proper highlighting for TOML comments (`#`)
- **Bracket Matching**: Auto-closing pairs for brackets, quotes, and parentheses
- **Code Folding**: Collapsible sections for better navigation
- **Error Tolerance**: Graceful handling of malformed TOML syntax
